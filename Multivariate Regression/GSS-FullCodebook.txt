           Note that White does not include those who said they were Hispanic.
           And Hispanic does not include those who said they were black.

           Since GSS did not ask about Hispanic identification before the
           2000 survey, this variable only has valid codes from 2000 and later.
           Pre-2000 respondents are coded 9, which is defined as missing data.

           few of them. On each line the first word is in capital letters
           like BEAST. Then there are five other words. Tell me the number
           of the word that comes closest to the meaning of the word in
           capital letters. For example, if the word in capital letters is
           BEAST, you would say "4" since "animal" come closer to BEAST
           than any of the other words. If you wish, I will read the words
           to you. These words are difficult for almost everyone just give
           me your best guess if you are not sure of the answer.

           73b. for some time there have been discussions about how
           concerned the government should be about the social welfare of

      EQWLTH             SHOULD GOVT REDUCE INCOME DIFFERENCES

           74a. Some people think that the government in Washington ought
           to reduce the income differences between the rich and the poor,
           perhaps by raising the taxes of wealthy families or by giving
           income assistance to the poor. Others think that the government
           should not concern itself with reducing this income difference
           between the rich and the poor. Here is a card with a scale from
           1 to 7. Think of a score of 1 as meaning that the government
           ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor,
           and a score of 7 meaning that the government should not concern
           itself with reducing income differences. What score between 1
           and 7 comes closest to the way you feel?

           to tell me which is the closest to your own view: 1. The Bible
           is God's word and all it says is true. 2. The Bible was written
           by men inspired by God, but it contains some human errors. 3.
           The Bible is a good book because it was written by wise men, but
           God had nothing to do with it. 4. The Bible was written by men
           who lived so long ago that it is worth very little today.

           122. I'd like to get your feelings toward groups that are in teh
           news these days. I will use something we call the feeling
           thermometer, and here is how it works: I'll read the names of a
           group and I'd like you to rate that group using the feeling
           thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean
           that you feel favorable and warm toward the group. Ratings
           between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel
           favorable toward the group and that you don't care too much for
           that group. e. Jews

      GENEJOB            SHOULD EMPLOYERS GIVE GENETIC TESTS

           415. Here are some questions about a new scientfic technology
           called "genetic screening." Using genetic screening, it is now
           possible to tell whether someone has inherited a tendency to
           develop certain cancers and certain forms of heart disease.
           These tests do not mean that a person will always develop the
           disease, but only that he or she may do so, depending on other
           conditions. a. Should employers have the right to give these
           genetic tests to people who are applying for a job, or shouldn't
           they have that right?
